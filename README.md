# Show, Attend and Tell 
<b> This code is based on the code of yunjey</b>, you can check https://github.com/yunjey/show-attend-and-tell-tensorflow to know how to use this code.

The modification I made is changing the image-encoder to Resnet-101 by Pytorch, you may want to take a look at prepro.py and modify line 197 to change the encoder to other CNN models.
